# 🤖 Simple Chat Bot

A **simple Java console-based chatbot** built as part of a learning project.  
This bot demonstrates basic **Java programming concepts** such as:

- User input handling  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `switch`)  
- Modular code with methods  
- Basic debugging and problem-solving techniques

---

## 🚀 Features
- Greets the user and asks for their name.
- Guesses the user's age using math and modular arithmetic.
- Counts from `0` to a user-specified number.
- Includes a **multiple-choice quiz**:
  - Repeats until the correct answer is provided.
  - Congratulates the user upon completion.

## 🖥️ Example Interaction

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.

Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
1
2
1
Your age is 22; that’s a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
3
0!
1!

3!
Let’s test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?

1.	To repeat a statement multiple times.
2.	To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3.	To determine the execution time of a program.
4.	To interrupt the execution of a program.
